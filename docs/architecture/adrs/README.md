# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Pose Coach Android application. ADRs document the architectural decisions made during the development process, including the context, decision rationale, and consequences.

   - **Status**: Accepted
   - **Decision**: Multi-layered performance optimization for <30ms inference
   - **Key Benefits**: Real-time performance, device compatibility, adaptive quality, battery efficiency

## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use the following template structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the problem/issue that needs to be addressed]

## Decision
[Describe the chosen solution/approach]

## Rationale
[Explain why this decision was made, including key benefits]

## Alternatives Considered
[List other options that were evaluated and why they were not chosen]

## Consequences
### Positive
[List benefits and advantages of this decision]

### Negative
[List drawbacks and limitations of this decision]

## Implementation Guidelines
[Provide guidance on how to implement this decision]

## References
[Include relevant documentation, standards, or resources]
```

## ADR Lifecycle

### Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: ADR is under review and discussion
- **Accepted**: ADR has been approved and should be implemented
- **Rejected**: ADR has been reviewed and rejected
- **Deprecated**: ADR is no longer relevant but kept for historical reference
- **Superseded**: ADR has been replaced by a newer ADR

### Review Process

1. **Creation**: Draft ADR following the template
2. **Review**: Technical review by architecture team
3. **Discussion**: Team discussion and feedback incorporation
4. **Decision**: Final approval or rejection
5. **Implementation**: Execute the decision if accepted
6. **Monitoring**: Track implementation and consequences

## Compliance and Standards

All ADRs must consider:

- **Privacy Regulations**: GDPR, CCPA compliance
- **Security Standards**: Data protection and encryption
- **Performance Requirements**: <30ms inference, 60fps processing
- **Testing Standards**: >80% coverage, TDD methodology
- **Accessibility**: WCAG guidelines compliance
- **Platform Standards**: Android development best practices

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Review Schedule
- **Quarterly**: Review all active ADRs for relevance
- **Release Cycles**: Update ADRs based on implementation learnings
- **Architecture Changes**: Create new ADRs for significant decisions
- **Technology Updates**: Evaluate impact on existing ADRs

### Change Management
