# Specification Steering System - Quick Start Guide

## Overview

This quick start guide helps you immediately begin using the Specification Steering System for the Pose Coach Android project. Follow these steps to leverage the comprehensive specification management capabilities with Claude Code agents.

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI installed and configured
- Pose Coach Android project cloned
- Claude Flow (optional but recommended for advanced features)

## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Initialize Specification Environment

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd pose-coach-android-starter

# Verify specification structure is in place
ls -la docs/specifications/
ls -la docs/templates/
ls -la docs/processes/

# Initialize SPARC if not already done
npx claude-flow@alpha init --sparc
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Specification

```bash
# Use the specification agent to create a new feature specification
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run specification \
  "Create comprehensive specification for [YOUR_FEATURE_NAME]"

# Example: Create specification for enhanced live coaching
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run specification \
  "Create comprehensive specification for enhanced live coaching with multi-language support"
```

### Step 3: Coordinate Multi-Agent Specification Development

```bash
# Run coordinated specification development
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc batch \
  "specification,system-architect,api-docs,tester" \
  "Develop complete specification package for [YOUR_FEATURE_NAME]"
```

## 15-Minute Full Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirement Analysis (5 minutes)

```bash
# Step 1: Comprehensive requirement analysis
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run specification \
  "Analyze requirements for [FEATURE] considering current P4 Sprint 4 state"

  "Assess technical feasibility and architecture impact for [FEATURE]"

# Step 3: Research and validation
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run researcher \
  "Research best practices and validate business requirements for [FEATURE]"
```

### Phase 2: Detailed Specification (5 minutes)

```bash
# Step 4: Create detailed specifications in parallel
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc batch \
  "specification,system-architect,api-docs" \
  "Create detailed specification package: requirements, architecture, and API specs for [FEATURE]"
```

### Phase 3: Validation and Review (5 minutes)

```bash
# Step 5: Quality validation and review
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc batch \
  "reviewer,tester,perf-analyzer" \
  "Review and validate specification completeness and quality for [FEATURE]"

# Step 6: Generate test specifications
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run tester \
  "Generate comprehensive test specifications based on requirements for [FEATURE]"
```

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: New Feature Specification

```bash
# Example: New AI-powered pose correction feature

  "Create specification for AI-powered real-time pose correction feature with biomechanical analysis"

# Follow up with technical analysis
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run system-architect \
  "Design architecture for AI pose correction integration with existing live coaching system"
```

### Use Case 2: Performance Enhancement Specification

```bash
# Example: Enhanced performance optimization
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc batch \
  "specification,perf-analyzer,system-architect" \
  "Create specification for next-generation performance optimization targeting 60 FPS on mid-range devices"
```

### Use Case 3: Privacy Feature Enhancement

```bash
# Example: Advanced privacy controls
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc batch \
  "specification,researcher,system-architect" \
  "Create specification for advanced privacy controls including federated learning and on-device AI"
```

### Use Case 4: API Specification Creation

```bash
# Create API specifications for new endpoints
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run api-docs \
  "Create OpenAPI specification for new pose analytics endpoints based on performance requirements"
```

## Template Usage

### Quick Requirement Creation

```bash
# Copy and customize requirement template
cp docs/templates/requirement-template.md docs/specifications/requirements/functional/REQ-NEW-001.md

# Use agent to populate template
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run specification \
  "Populate requirement template REQ-NEW-001 for [SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENT]"
```

### Quick ADR Creation

```bash
# Copy and customize ADR template
cp docs/templates/adr-template.md docs/specifications/architecture/decisions/ADR-001-[DECISION_TOPIC].md

# Use agent to create ADR
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run system-architect \
  "Create architecture decision record for [TECHNICAL_DECISION] in ADR-001"
```

## Traceability Quick Start

### Initialize Traceability Matrix

```bash
# Generate initial traceability matrix
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run code-analyzer \
  "Generate traceability matrix for current Pose Coach implementation"

# Identify coverage gaps
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run tester \
  "Analyze test coverage gaps in current implementation"
```

### Update Traceability

```bash
# Update traceability after new specifications
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run specification \
  "Update traceability matrix with new specifications and implementation links"
```

## Review and Validation Quick Commands

### Specification Quality Check

```bash
# Quick quality validation
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run reviewer \
  "Validate specification completeness and quality for all pending specifications"

# Check stakeholder alignment
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run planner \
  "Assess stakeholder alignment and approval status for current specifications"
```

### Implementation Readiness Check

```bash
# Validate implementation readiness
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc batch \
  "system-architect,tester,reviewer" \
  "Validate implementation readiness for approved specifications"
```

## Daily Workflow

  --validate-specifications \
  --check-traceability

# Post-merge specification updates
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-merge \
  --update-traceability \
  --regenerate-documentation

# Re-run with explicit coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc batch \
  "specification,system-architect" \
  "Coordinate specification development with explicit handoff protocols"
```

**Issue: Traceability matrix not updating**
```bash
# Force traceability regeneration
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run code-analyzer \
  "Force regenerate complete traceability matrix from current codebase"

# Validate traceability links
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run specification \
  "Validate and repair traceability links for all specifications"
```

**Issue: Specification quality concerns**
```bash
# Comprehensive quality review
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run reviewer \
  "Conduct comprehensive specification quality review with improvement recommendations"

# Stakeholder alignment check
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run planner \
  "Check stakeholder alignment and identify consensus gaps"
```
