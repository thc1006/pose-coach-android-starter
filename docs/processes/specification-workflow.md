# Specification Workflow Process

## Overview

The Specification Workflow Process defines the systematic approach for creating, reviewing, approving, and maintaining specifications within the Pose Coach Android project. This process integrates with the SPARC methodology and leverages Claude Code agents for efficient coordination.

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Requirement Initiation

**Triggers:**
- New feature requests from stakeholders
- Technical debt identification
- Performance optimization needs
- Security or compliance requirements
- User feedback and enhancement requests

**Process:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Requirement Request] --> B[Initial Assessment]
    B --> C{Priority Level?}
    C -->|Critical| D[Immediate Processing]
    C -->|High| E[Next Sprint Planning]
    C -->|Medium| F[Backlog Addition]
    C -->|Low| G[Future Consideration]

    D --> H[Stakeholder Alignment]
    E --> H
    F --> H
    H --> I[Requirement Documentation]
```

**Agent Coordination:**
```yaml
initiation_agents:
  requirement_analyst:
    agent: "specification"
    task: "Analyze and document initial requirements"
    output: "requirement-draft.md"

  business_analyst:
    agent: "researcher"
    task: "Research business context and user impact"
