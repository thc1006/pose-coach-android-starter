# SPARC Specification Integration

## Overview

This document defines the integration of the Specification Steering System with the existing SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology for the Pose Coach Android project. The integration enhances each SPARC phase with systematic specification management while leveraging Claude Code agents for efficient coordination.

  "specification,researcher,system-architect" \
  "Coordinate comprehensive specification development with traceability"

# Quality validation
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run reviewer \

```

## Phase 2: Pseudocode Phase with Specification Alignment

### Specification-Driven Pseudocode Development

**Enhanced Pseudocode Process:**
```yaml
pseudocode_phase_enhancement:
  specification_alignment:
    - "Pseudocode directly maps to specification requirements"
    - "Traceability links maintained from spec to pseudocode"
    - "Algorithm design validates against acceptance criteria"

  agent_coordination:
    primary_agent:
      - agent: "coder"
        task: "Create specification-aligned pseudocode"
        input: "Enhanced specification deliverables"
        validation: "Requirement coverage verification"

    supporting_agents:
      - agent: "system-architect"
        task: "Validate architectural consistency"
      - agent: "tester"
        task: "Verify testability of pseudocode design"

  traceability_updates:
    - "Link pseudocode blocks to specific requirements"
    - "Update traceability matrix with design decisions"
    - "Document algorithm choice rationale"
```

**Example: Pose Detection Pseudocode Alignment**
```yaml
pose_detection_pseudocode:
  requirement_id: "REQ-POSE-001"
  requirement: "Detect pose landmarks with 95% accuracy"

  pseudocode_mapping:
    algorithm_design: |
      FUNCTION detectPose(imageInput):
          // REQ-POSE-001: Accuracy requirement
          validateInputImageQuality(imageInput)

          // REQ-PERF-001: Performance requirement
          optimizedImage = preprocessImage(imageInput, currentPerformanceLevel)

          // REQ-MULTI-001: Multi-person support
          rawDetections = mediaPipeDetector.detect(optimizedImage)

          // REQ-POSE-001: Accuracy validation
          filteredDetections = filterByConfidenceThreshold(rawDetections, 0.95)

          RETURN formatPoseResult(filteredDetections)

    traceability_links:
      - "validateInputImageQuality() implements REQ-PRIV-002 (privacy validation)"
      - "preprocessImage() implements REQ-PERF-002 (performance optimization)"
      - "filterByConfidenceThreshold() implements REQ-POSE-001 (accuracy requirement)"
```

```

## Phase 4: Refinement with Continuous Validation

### Test-Driven Refinement with Specification Validation
