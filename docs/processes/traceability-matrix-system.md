# Requirement Traceability Matrix System

## Overview

The Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) system provides end-to-end traceability from business requirements through implementation to testing and validation. This system ensures comprehensive coverage and impact analysis for the Pose Coach Android project.

## Traceability Matrix Structure

### Forward Traceability (Requirements → Implementation)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Business Requirements] --> B[Functional Requirements]
    B --> C[Technical Requirements]
    C --> D[Architecture Decisions]
    D --> E[API Specifications]
    E --> F[Implementation Code]
    F --> G[Unit Tests]
    G --> H[Integration Tests]
    H --> I[Acceptance Tests]
```

### Backward Traceability (Implementation → Requirements)

```mermaid
graph RL
    I[Test Results] --> H[Test Cases]
    H --> G[Code Implementation]
    G --> F[API Endpoints]
    F --> E[Architecture Components]
    E --> D[Technical Specifications]
    D --> C[Functional Requirements]
    C --> B[Business Requirements]
    B --> A[Stakeholder Needs]
```

```

### Relationship Types

**Depends On:** Requirement A needs Requirement B to be implemented first
**Implements:** Component A implements Requirement B
**Tests:** Test Case A validates Requirement B
**Conflicts:** Requirement A conflicts with Requirement B
**Derives From:** Requirement A is derived from Business Need B

## Automated Traceability Tools

### Agent-Based Matrix Generation

```yaml
traceability_agents:
  matrix_generator:
    agent: "code-analyzer"
    task: "Scan codebase and extract traceability links"
    frequency: "daily"
    output: "traceability-matrix.yaml"

  gap_analyzer:
    agent: "tester"
    task: "Identify requirements without test coverage"
    frequency: "sprint_end"
    output: "coverage-gaps.yaml"

  impact_analyzer:
    agent: "system-architect"
    task: "Analyze change impact across dependencies"
    frequency: "on_change"
    output: "impact-analysis.yaml"
```

### Matrix Validation Rules

```yaml
validation_rules:
  completeness:
    - rule: "All critical requirements must have implementation"
      query: "requirement.priority == 'critical' AND implementation == null"
      severity: "error"

    - rule: "All requirements must have test cases"
      query: "requirement.type == 'functional' AND test_cases.length == 0"
      severity: "warning"

  consistency:
    - rule: "Implementation status must match requirement status"
      query: "requirement.status == 'completed' AND implementation.status != 'completed'"
      severity: "error"

    - rule: "All tests must pass for completed features"
      query: "requirement.status == 'completed' AND test_results.contains('failed')"
      severity: "error"
```
